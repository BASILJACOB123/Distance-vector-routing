# Distance-vector-routing
A distance-vector routing (DVR) protocol requires that a router inform its neighbors of topology changes periodically. Historically known as the old ARPANET routing algorithm (or known as Bellman-Ford algorithm). This code gives the algorithm behind the implementation of a DVR
